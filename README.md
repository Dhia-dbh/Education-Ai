# Education-AI

An AI-powered solution that utilizes computer vision to alert school teachers about pupils who might suffer from eyesight problems or ADHD. By analyzing sight direction, eye movement, and eye openness levels, we can detect early signs of eye fatigue and low levels of attention

## Structure
This repository is organised as follows:
- `backend/`: A folder with all the code for the Education AI platform's backend, including API endpoints, database models and business logic implemented in Python using the Flask framework.
- `frontend/`: This folder contains an implementation of the frontend side of the Education AI platform with JavaScript and React. This folder contains the user interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- `models/`: This is a directory containing the trained generative AI models used by Education AI toward improving its ability. These models are implemented using some Python-based AI/ML libraries and are core in attempts to solve well-defined problems like visual question answering.
- `bot/`: This directory holds source code for the telegram bot, so as to be usable from within telegram groups or chat with the telegram bot.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for development and improvement of the Education AI platform. By making the repository publicly accessible, we aim to foster community engagement, allowing developers, contributors, and users to explore the codebase, report issues, and suggest enhancements.
