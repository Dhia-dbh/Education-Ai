# Education-AI

Education-AI is a multifaceted platform designed to assist both teachers and students, with a primary focus on supporting students who face focus challenges, such as those with ADHD. By leveraging computer vision (CV) tools and artificial intelligence (AI), our platform enhances the educational experience and provides real-time support.

## Core Features and Functionalities

### Focus Tracking and Alerts
- **Computer Vision Integration**: Uses CV tools to monitor and track students' focus levels during class or study sessions.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Automatically alerts teachers when a student is experiencing focus issues, enabling timely intervention and support.

### Course Material Analysis and Assistance
- **Course Uploads**: Allows teachers and professionals to upload course materials, such as textbooks, lecture notes, and assignments.
- **AI Analysis**: Utilizes AI models to analyze uploaded course materials and generate summaries, key points, and quizzes.
- **Interactive Assistance**: Provides real-time assistance to students as they read through the material, offering explanations, answering questions, and suggesting related content.

## Structure
This repository is organized as follows:
- `backend/`: Contains all the code for the Education AI platform's backend, including API endpoints, database models, and business logic implemented in Python using the Flask framework.
- `frontend/`: Houses the frontend implementation of the Education AI platform using JavaScript and React, including the user interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- `models/`: Includes the trained generative AI models used by Education AI to enhance its capabilities. These models are implemented using Python-based AI/ML libraries and are crucial for solving well-defined problems like visual question answering.

## Purpose
Education-AI aims to improve access to education in developing countries and enhance academic results worldwide. It helps prevent severe signs of ADHD and addresses learning difficulties. In an age where attention spans are at their lowest, Education-AI helps students stay focused longer and improve attention levels.

This repository serves as a collaborative hub for developing and enhancing Education AI. By keeping it public, we invite developers, contributors, and users to review the code, report problems, and suggest improvements. Together, we strive for a better future.
